# Tiresias — Session Memory

Read this at the start of every Cowork session to pick up where we left off.

## What this project is

**Tiresias** — a prediction market reputation and badging platform. Aggregates a user's prediction history across Kalshi, Polymarket, Manifold, and Metaculus; computes Brier scores and calibration; issues badges; publishes to X/Bluesky. Three SvelteKit frontends (user dashboard, public leaderboard, public profile).

Full architecture is in `README.md`.

## Current state (as of 2026-04-14)

### What's built and working
- All data-layer models, migrations, CRUD (migrations 0001–0003)
- All four connector services (Kalshi, Polymarket, Manifold, Metaculus) — clients, adapters, sync functions
- Scoring engine (Brier, calibration, BSS)
- Badge service (catalogue, issuer, diff)
- Auth service (JWT, registration, linked accounts)
- Notification service (dispatcher + templates — **stubs only**, handlers not implemented)
- API gateway (routes wired up)
- User dashboard SvelteKit app
- **Scheduler — just fully implemented this session** (see below)

### What was just completed (this session)
The scheduler (`services/scheduler/`) was a skeleton with four `NotImplementedError` stubs. We implemented everything:

**Data-layer additions** (required by scheduler):
- `Market` model: added `source` + `external_id` columns, partial unique index `uq_market_source_external`
- `Prediction` model: added `source` + `external_id` columns
- `UserScore` model: added `badge_ids JSONB` column
- `MarketCRUD`: added `get_by_external`, `upsert_from_sync`, `list_resolved_with_unscored_predictions`
- `PredictionCRUD`: added `upsert_from_sync`
- `UserCRUD`: added `list_active`
- Migration `0003_sync_external_ids.py` covers all of the above

**New scheduler files**:
- `scheduler/credentials.py` — Fernet decryption for stored API keys (`CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var)
- `scheduler/sync.py` — per-platform sync helpers: `sync_one_user()` + `_sync_kalshi/manifold/metaculus/polymarket()`
- `scheduler/jobs.py` — all 4 jobs fully implemented (see below)
- `scheduler/tests/test_jobs.py` — 20 test cases
- `requirements.txt` updated (added sqlalchemy, asyncpg, cryptography)
- `Containerfile` updated (now copies data-layer, scoring-engine, badge-service, notification-service)

**The 4 jobs:**
1. `sync_user_predictions(user_id)` — on-demand, syncs one user across all linked platforms
2. `sync_all_markets()` — every 15 min, calls sync_one_user for all active users
3. `detect_and_score_resolutions()` — every 5 min, scores resolved predictions, updates UserScore, evaluates badges, dispatches notifications
4. `rebuild_leaderboard()` — every 1 hr, full recompute of user_scores from raw predictions

### What's NOT done yet
- Notification service handlers (`_handle_market_resolved`, `_handle_badge_earned`, `_handle_rank_change` all raise `NotImplementedError`) — scheduler calls dispatch() but silently swallows these errors for now
- Auth service credential verification stubs (`verify_kalshi_credential` etc. all raise `NotImplementedError`)
- Kalshi per-user credentials — currently uses env-var-based RSA key (single key for all users); per-user Kalshi support requires passing PEM bytes to KalshiClient constructor
- Integration / E2E tests (`tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/` directories exist but are empty)
- Public leaderboard and public profile SvelteKit apps (may not exist yet)

## Known issues / active debugging

### Scheduler end-to-end verified ✓
DB connectivity confirmed and scheduler runs successfully. Key findings:
- DB URL must use `postgresql+asyncpg://` (not `postgresql://`) for async engine
- Port is `5432`, host is `127.0.0.1` (not `localhost`) on Mac with Podman/gvproxy
- `DATABASE_URL` must be set **before** importing `scheduler.jobs` (engine is created at module load time)
- The Python REPL requires pressing **Enter twice** to execute a multi-line block

### Linked account setup for local testing
User `a80f20a1-f307-49e6-8676-34e5aa79e59c` (jeremiahbuckley) has a Metaculus linked account.
Needs `is_enabled=true`, `is_verified=true`, and correct integer Metaculus user ID in `external_identifier`.
Credential must be Fernet-encrypted using `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — use `scripts/cred.py` for this.

```bash
# Encrypt a token
python scripts/cred.py encrypt "your-raw-token"

# Then update the DB row
podman exec -it <postgres-container> psql -U postgres -d tiresias -c "
UPDATE linked_accounts
SET is_enabled=true, is_verified=true,
    external_identifier='<metaculus-integer-id>',
    credential_encrypted='<encrypted-output>'
WHERE user_id='a80f20a1-f307-49e6-8676-34e5aa79e59c' AND platform='metaculus';"
```

## Key architectural decisions made

- One prediction per (user_id, market_id) — manually-entered predictions are never overwritten by syncs
- External synced predictions use the most recent bet's probability (last-write-wins per market)
- Badge state stored as JSONB on UserScore (not a separate table) for V1 simplicity
- Notification errors are non-fatal in the scheduler — `NotImplementedError` from stub handlers is silently swallowed
- Scheduler imports other services as Python packages (not HTTP) — all bundled in one container
- Kalshi uses env-var RSA key for V1 (per-user Kalshi keys are a future improvement)
- `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var holds the Fernet key for decrypting stored API keys

## How to run things locally

```bash
# Start DB
podman compose up -d db   # from repo root

# Set up Python path (from services/)
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/scheduler:$PWD/data-layer:$PWD/scoring-engine:$PWD/badge-service:$PWD/notification-service:$PWD/connector-kalshi:$PWD/connector-manifold:$PWD/connector-metaculus:$PWD/connector-polymarket"

# Run migrations
cd data-layer
DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/tiresias?ssl=disable" \
PYTHONPATH=. alembic upgrade head
cd ..

# Start scheduler
DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/tiresias?ssl=disable" \
python -m scheduler.runner

# Start API
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/tiresias?ssl=disable"
export JWT_SECRET_KEY=$(python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))")
uvicorn api_gateway.app:app --app-dir api-gateway --reload --port 8000
```

Note: use `127.0.0.1` not `localhost`, and `?ssl=disable` — required due to Podman/gvproxy on Mac.

## Security / secrets tooling added

- `scripts/cred.py` — encrypt/decrypt credentials for the DB using the Fernet key
- `.env.example` — template showing all required env vars (safe to commit, no real values)
- `.gitleaks.toml` — gitleaks config extending the default ruleset with project-specific allowlists
- `.git/hooks/pre-commit` — blocks commits containing detected secrets (requires `brew install gitleaks`)

**QA secrets workflow:**
1. Generate a key once: `python scripts/cred.py genkey`
2. Share the key out-of-band (encrypted email, 1Password, etc.)
3. Each dev puts it in `.env.local` (gitignored)
4. Encrypt tokens before storing in DB: `python scripts/cred.py encrypt "raw-token"`

---

## What to work on next (suggested order)

1. **Complete Metaculus sync end-to-end** — fix linked_account row (is_enabled, correct integer user ID, encrypted token) and verify predictions appear in DB
2. **Implement notification service handlers** (email via Resend/SendGrid/Postmark)
3. **Implement auth service credential verifiers** (`verify_kalshi_credential` etc. all raise `NotImplementedError`)
4. **Integration tests** — wire up `tests/integration/` with a real test DB
5. **Public leaderboard + public profile** frontend apps
